   - Support Poisson Arrival request mode
   - Support fixed RR (Round Robin) request mode
   - Support trace file format from Mooncake paper, implementing traffic load replay

4. **Accuracy Alignment Guarantee**:
   - Use the same evaluation metrics and calculation methods as OpenCompass
   - Ensure consistency of evaluation results, accuracy difference <1%

## 4.2 Constraints

   - Validate file format to prevent malicious files

### 7.1.3 External Interaction Party Analysis

Threat analysis is performed on external interaction parties in the data flow diagram. External interaction parties need to analyze two threats: spoofing and repudiation.

### 7.2.2 Privacy Risk Pre-analysis Summary

**Summary**: The current version does not involve personal data collection, therefore this version does not require privacy risk analysis.

The main function of AISBench benchmark tool is to evaluate AI model accuracy and performance. The data processed includes:

- Dataset files: Dataset files provided by users for model evaluation
- Inference results: Results generated by model inference
- Evaluation metrics: Calculated evaluation metrics (such as accuracy, Rouge scores, etc.)

None of the above data involves personal data. The tool does not collect, store, or process any personal data.

### 7.2.3 Personal Data List

**Personal Data List**: None

AISBench benchmark tool does not collect or process personal data, therefore there is no need to list a personal data list.

### 7.2.4 Privacy Protection Requirement Design

Since this tool does not involve personal data collection, there is no need for privacy protection requirement design.

### 7.2.5 Privacy Protection Measures

Although this tool does not involve personal data collection, the following measures are taken to ensure user data security:

1. **Data Minimization Principle**: Tool only processes data required for evaluation, does not collect additional information
2. **Data Desensitization**: Do not print sensitive information (such as API Key) in logs
3. **Data Localization**: Evaluation results are stored locally by users, controlled by users for access permissions
4. **Secure Data Transmission**: Support HTTPS protocol to protect data transmission security
